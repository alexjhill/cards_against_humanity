# Cards Against Humanity Online

[Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) is an existing card party game and is great to play with friends but, due to the lockdown, that can't happen. As an attempt to claim back some modicum of social interaction, I decided to make a web version! ...plus I wanted to learn React. Other web versions of the game existed but their interfaces were problematic, especially when paired to large amounts of web traffic.

All the data for the cards was taken from the [JSON Against Humanity API](https://www.crhallberg.com/cah/). CAH is distributed under Creative Commons, [as described in their FAQs](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/#info), making this all legal as long as I don't make any money from it (so please don't send me any).
